# Betting Data API Configuration

This document provides an overview of the configuration options for using the WinWise arbitrage betting calculator API. This API will accept your betting data and determine the best wager values such that you will profit no matter the result (a.k.a. arbitrage betting). You can customize the behaviour of the API using the following parameters:

## Wager Limit (default: -1)

The `wager_limit` parameter specifies the maximum amount that can be wagered on the event in total. If no wager limits are defined here or in bookmakers, this value will default to 100, such that all wager values represent a percentage of the total stake.

Example:
```json
"wager_limit": 1000
```

### Note:
When placing lay bets the calculator will ensure the liability of the bet does not exceed any wager limits. This will guarantee that you are never expose more than your wager limit.

## Wager Precision (default: 0.01)

Wager precision was introduced to make betting activity less conspicuous. The `wager_precision` parameter determines the precision of calculated wager amounts. All calculated wager amounts will be a multiple of this value. For instance, setting `wager_precision` to 10 will ensure that all calculated wagers are a multiple of 10, except of course for bets that have an associated bookmaker with `ignore_wager_precision` set to true.

Example:
```json
"wager_precision": 10
```

## Bookmakers

The `bookmakers` parameter allows you to define an array of bookmakers with their specific settings. Each bookmaker object should have the following properties:

| Required | Property                | Data Type  | Description                                                      | Default Value |
|----------|-------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
|   ✔️     | `id`                    | Integer    | Unique identifier of the bookmaker.                              |               |
|          | `commission`            | Number     | The commission rate charged by the bookmaker.                    | 0.0           |
|          | `wager_limit`           | Number     | The maximum amount that can be wagered with this bookmaker.      | -1 (no limit) |
|          | `ignore_wager_precision`| Boolean    | Ignore the `wager_precision` value for all bets within bookmaker | `false`       |
|          | `max_wager_count`       | Integer    | Maximum number of wagers allowed.                                | -1 (no limit) |


Example:
```json
"bookmakers": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "commission": 0.05,
        "wager_limit": 500,
        "ignore_wager_precision": true
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "max_wager_count": 2
    }
]
```

### Notes:
It is generally advised to set `ignore_wager_precision` to true for bookmakers that are unlikely to ban you for suspicious betting activity. This will allow the calculator to optimise your wagers to be more profitable.
If no bookmakers are defined, the Calculator will default to using a single bookmaker with an ID of 0 and no commission or wager limit.

## *Bets

The `bets` parameter is an array of betting options for the event. Bet object may have the following properties:

| Required | Property         | Data Type         | Description                                                     | Default Value | Example |

|          | `lay`            | Boolean           | Indicates whether the bet is a 'lay' bet.                       | false         | true    |
|          | `volume`         | Number            | The volume associated with this bet (default: -1 for no limit). | -1.0          | 1000.25 |
|          | `previous_wager` | Number            | Total amount already wagered on this bet at these odds.         | 0.0           | 500.0   |
|          | `wager`          | Number            | Calculated wager to place on this bet (set by calculator).      | 0.0           | 250.0   |


Example:
```json
"bets": [
    {
        "bet_type": 1,
        "value": "home",
        "odds": 2.0,
        "bookmaker": 1
    },
    {
        "bet_type": 1,
        "value": "home -0.75",
        "odds": 1.8,
        "bookmaker": 2,

    }
]
